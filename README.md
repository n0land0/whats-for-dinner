## Abstract
  - I built this app as a resource for the perpetually hungry & terminally indecisive, and as a sandbox for my learning in front-end technologies (especially CSS).

## Technologies
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - HTML

## Wins
  - Logged a lot of time exploring CSS, most of which was completely new to me
  - Gained a much better understanding of flexbox
  - Learned how animations in CSS work
  - Learned about timeouts in JS
  - Succesfully used querySelectorAll after not understanding it very well in the pertinent lesson
  - Learned about forms in HTML and different input types

## Challenges + Improvements
  - Would've liked to get to other page functionality in JS, while I was caught up in getting comfortable in CSS
  - Consulted with an alum and learned a lot about best practices and workflow in CSS - will be sure to implement these in future stylesheets to make organization much cleaner
  - Couldn't get some global rules to respond to a button - will have to look into possible causes for that
  - Still don't feel super comfortable with event targeting, although I figured it out in the limited scope of this project
